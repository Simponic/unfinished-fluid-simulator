# (Unfinished) Eulerian Fluid Simulator

Unless you're looking for a place to start a project on Fluid Simulation, this is not the repository for you, as I never finished this project (and probably never will due to my ever-growing hatred for the nature of unsolvability of the Navier-Stokes equations)

I did comment on most of the code to explain what I was thinking while writing it, but beware, I'm not even sure if it is accurate.

Resources I used while learning about fluids and such:
